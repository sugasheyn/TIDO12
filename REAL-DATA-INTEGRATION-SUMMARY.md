- **FDA MAUDE Database**: Retrieves medical device safety reports

### 2. New API Route (`app/api/real-data/route.ts`)
- RESTful endpoint serving real data from all sources
- Support for filtering by source type
- Configurable data limits
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Real Data Dashboard (`components/real-data-dashboard.tsx`)
- **Overview Tab**: Recent data items and category distribution
- **Technology Tab**: GitHub repositories and tech discussions
- **Research Tab**: PubMed papers and clinical trials
- **Community Tab**: Reddit discussions and health platform posts
- Real-time data refresh capabilities
- Source verification badges and quality indicators

### 4. New Page (`app/real-data/page.tsx`)
- Dedicated page showcasing the real data dashboard
- Accessible via main navigation tab

### 5. Updated Components

## Usage Examples

### Viewing Real Data
1. Navigate to the "Real Data" tab in the main navigation
2. Browse different categories (Technology, Research, Community)
3. Click on items to view source details
4. Use the refresh button to get latest data

### API Integration
```javascript
// Fetch all real data
const response = await fetch('/api/real-data?source=all')
const data = await response.json()

// Fetch specific source
const pubmedData = await fetch('/api/real-data?source=pubmed')
const clinicalTrials = await fetch('/api/real-data?source=clinical-trials')
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Data Export**: CSV/JSON download capabilities
- **Advanced Filtering**: Date ranges, categories, source types
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs for data analysis
